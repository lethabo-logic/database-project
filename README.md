# 🏥 Clinic Booking System – MySQL Database Project

## 📘 Description
This project is a MySQL-based **Clinic Booking System** designed to handle patient records, doctor information, appointment scheduling, and billing. It demonstrates key relational database concepts including normalization, foreign key constraints, and entity relationships.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a normalized, relational database for a real-world use case.
- Implement tables with constraints (PK, FK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL).
- Define 1:1, 1:M, and M:M relationships.
- Provide a single, well-commented `.sql` file for reproducibility.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL (DDL)
- Draw.io / dbdiagram.io (for ERD)
- Git & GitHub
